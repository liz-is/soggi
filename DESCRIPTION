Title: Visualise ChIP-seq, MNase-seq and motif occurrence as aggregate
    plots Summarised Over Grouped Genomic Intervals

Description: The soGGi package provides a toolset to create genomic
    interval aggregate/summary plots of signal or motif occurence
    from BAM and bigWig files as well as PWM, rlelist, GRanges and
    GAlignments Bioconductor objects. soGGi allows for
    normalisation, transformation and arithmetic operation on and
    between summary plot objects as well as grouping and subsetting
    of plots by GRanges objects and user supplied metadata. Plots
    are created using the GGplot2 libary to allow user defined
    manipulation of the returned plot object. Coupled together,
    soGGi features a broad set of methods to visualise genomics
    data in the context of groups of genomic intervals such as
    genes, superenhancers and transcription factor binding events.
